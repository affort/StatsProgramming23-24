# Statistical Programming: Assessment 3

This repository is for assessment 3 of the MATH11176 Statistical Programming course for the 2023-2024 academic year at the University of Edinburgh.
This was one of 6 courses I took in Semester One of my MSc in Statistics and Operational Research at the University of Edinburgh. 
The course is organised by Professor Simon Wood, Chair of Computational Statistics, School of Mathematics, The University of Edinburgh (simon.wood@ed.ac.uk).
The problem statement is in `Assessment 3 - Problem Statement.pdf`.

The task was to implement a thin plate spline function in `R`.
My solution to the assessment is in `s2566430.r`. 
Note that the code contains only functions, as per the requirements of the assessment. 
To test and see the output of the code, first load all the functions by running or using `source` on the file, then call either the `testing()` or `check_run_time()` functions in your `R` console.
More details of the implementation of the thin plate spline are in `s2566430.r`.

This individual assessment accounted for 40% of my final grade for the Statistical Programming course, and was to be completed within 10 days.
