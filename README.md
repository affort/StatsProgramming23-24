# Statistical Programming: Assessment 3

This repository is for Assessment 3 of the MATH11176 Statistical Programming course for the 2023-2024 academic year at the University of Edinburgh.
This was one of 6 courses I took in Semester One of my MSc in Statistics and Operational Research at the University of Edinburgh. 
The course is organised by Professor Simon Wood, Chair of Computational Statistics, School of Mathematics, The University of Edinburgh (simon.wood@ed.ac.uk).
The problem statement is in `Assessment 3 - Problem Statement.pdf`.

The task was to implement a thin plate spline function in `R`.
My solution to the assessment is in `s2566430.r`. 
This individual assessment accounted for 40% of my final grade for the Statistical Programming course, and was to be completed within 10 days.
